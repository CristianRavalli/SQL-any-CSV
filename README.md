# SQL-any-CSV
Use any IDE to query CSVs instead of using SQL GUIs and connecting to DBs
I often found it frustrating having to connect to databases just to practise SQL and using datasets I might not even be interested in. Finally, thanks to Thuwarakesh (Towards Data Science, 2023) I can demonstrate a way of querying any CSV file of interest to us. We can just use DuckDB in an IDE Notebook (Colab, Jupyter, etc.) instead of using an SQL GUI.

I would also like to thank Ramya ([Medium, 2021](https://medium.com/geekculture/eda-with-sql-mysql-4ac1ea1d977b)) for her EDA article on SQL.

I hope you will enjoy this.
